# Pytformer
## :computer: Info
This is Pytformer, a platformer made with PyGame.<br><br>
It is written in Python with PyGame as the main engine and deployed with pyinstaller<br>
It is a platformer, where you can jump, dash, dodge enemy bullets and kill them with dash!<br>
There is also an level editor!


## :hammer: How to build the project
You can use the app without building by going into dist/ and using .exe generated by pyinstaller!<br>
But If you want to build:
- Download PyGame
- Compile the PyInvaders.py file, compiling other ones without it doesn't result in anything
